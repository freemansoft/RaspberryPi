# Wifi and ssh
`Enable-Ethernet-Gadget.ps1` does more than enable just the gadget for the Raspberry Pi Zero
1. Enables SSH
1. Enables wifi if network name and password provided

## Setup
Run the `Enable-Ethernet-Gadget.ps1` as described below

# PiZero and Ethernet over USB
Windows Powershell scripts and automation for building and configuring Raspberry Pi (Zero W) as an Ethernet Gadget.  This means you can write a new Raspberry Pi Image and configure it for as a USB Network device and configure Wi-Fi before installing the card into a Raspberry Pi and starting it.

This _Powershell_ script configures a freshly created Raspberry Pi bootable SD card to appear as a private network when plugged into a computer over USB. This means you can configure the USB network and Wi-Fi for a brand new Raspberry Pi without logging into the box to do it. You get full network connectivity and tooling for working with a Raspberry Pi that would not otherwise be on a network.

I built this using PowerShell because my base laptop is a windows machine.

## Configure a Raspberry PI Zero O/S SDCard using Enable-Ethernet-Gadget.ps
1. Configures the Pi Zero USB as OTG
1. Makes the Pi appear a USB based network adapter with the Pi as the other device on the network. This is sometimes referred to as a _Network Gadget_ mode.
1. Enables SSH so you can ssh in over the USB connection or over wifi
1. _Optionally_ configures the wi-fi for a specific network
1. Copies some useful configuration scripts to the boot partition

## Script Usage
`Enable-Ethernet-Gadget -PIBootDrive F: -NetworkName my-ssid -NetworkPassword my-network-password`
* `PIBootDrive` The Drive letter for the SD card boot partition _Defaults to F:_
* `NetworkName` The SSID of your wireless network
* `NetworkPassword` The wireless network password

`NetworkName` and `NetworkPassword` are _optional_ parameters. Both are _required_ if either are specified.

## Steps to configure Pi Zero as USB Network Device
1. Create a new micro SD card using the _Raspberry Pi Imager_
    1. You may have to eject the card and re-insert it to mount the boot partition
1. Run the script `Enable-Ethernet-Gadget.ps` as described in _Usage_
1. Eject the card and insert into Raspberry Pi Zero
1. Plug the _USB_ port into your computer.
1. Plug a power adapter into the _POWER_ port on the Raspberry Pi Zero
1. Wait for the device to boot up. The first boot is the slowest as it unpacks the fresh O/S
1. You should see `USB Ethernet/RNDIS Gadget` in the _Device Manager_ control panel
  * ![Widnows Device Manager](./images/RaspberryPi-NDIS-Gadget.png)
  * Read [this blog](https://joe.blog.freemansoft.com/2022/11/installing-rndis-driver-on-windows-11.html) to learn hou can install the Windows RNDIS driver if you only see a `USB Serial Port` in the control panel. Should work for Windows 10 and Windows 11.
  
## Steps to configure Pi 3 or other _non Pi Zero_ devices
1. Create a new micro SD card using the _Raspberry Pi Imager_
    1. You may have to eject the card and re-insert it to mount the boot partition
1. Run the script `Enable-Ethernet-Gadget.ps` as described in _Usage_
1. Eject the card and insert into Raspberry Pi 3, etc.
1. Plug a hardwire ethernet connection in. We will disable wifi ssh access later.
1. Plug a power adapter into the _POWER_ port on the Raspberry Pi Zero
1. Wait for the device to boot up. The first boot is the slowest as it unpacks the fresh O/S
1. Proceed to verification

## Verify over the USB connection or Ethernet
1. `ping raspberrypi.local`
  ```
  PS C:\pi-zero-ethernet-gadget> ping raspberrypi.local
  Pinging raspberrypi.local [fe80::d31c:3ca4:a4b6:895f%61] with 32 bytes of data:
  Reply from fe80::d31c:3ca4:a4b6:895f%61: time=1ms

  Reply from fe80::d31c:3ca4:a4b6:895f%61: time<1ms
  ```
1. SSH to the device it is known as `raspberrypi.local` The default username is `pi` and the default password is `raspberry'
  * Using the linux WSL command prompt `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`
  * Using Putty... _to be added_

## Log in and verify wifi (optional)
1. SSH into the device
1. run `ifconfig wlan0` and verify the IP address is from your network. 
  * A `169.x.y.z` address means it did not work.

## Log in and set the hostname and firelall rules
1. SSH into the device
1. Follow the instructions in README-Provision-and-EtherGadget.md

## Troubleshooting
### Enabling Powershell scripts

You may have enable powershell scripts from an _elevated_ prompt
 `set-executionpolicy remotesigned`

### Enabling Debug Output

* Enable debug out put with
 *  `$DebugPreference = "Continue"`
* Disable debug with
 * `$DebugPreference = "SilentlyContinue"`
* Supposedly you can temporarily enable deebug outwith but I never got it to work: -Debug
